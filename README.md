Data Structures Assignment in 2021 first semester

This repository contains **the assignments of Sogang Data Structures(odd student ID class)** in the first semester in 2021.

The First Assignment is about the pattern matching algorithm. There are two source files. One is about KMP algorithm, and the other one is about naive pattern matching algorithm
using nested loops.

The Second Assignment is about the Heap data structure. The source contains both of the maximum heap and the minimum heap.

The last homework is about the Kruskal's Algorithm based on the minimum spanning trees, the minimum heap and the disjoint sets.

* **ALERT : If you, the reader is a student who takes the same course and have to do the same assignments, DO NOT COPY this codes. You can refer to the code to help yourself do the homework efficiently, but do not just copying at all.**
